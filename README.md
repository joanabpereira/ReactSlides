# React Slides

Back when I did my Master's dissertation I had to build a presentation tool using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I decided to redo it but using React this time as a side-project.

Built using a [React-Redux boilerplate](https://github.com/buckyroberts/React-Boilerplate) by [thenewboston.com](https://thenewboston.com/)

## Getting Started

To get started, first install all the necessary dependencies.
```
> npm install
```

Run an initial webpack build
```
> webpack
```

Start the development server (changes will now update live in browser)
```
> npm run start
```

To view your project, go to: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
